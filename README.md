# Django Projects

This repository contains various **Django applications** developed as part of my learning journey. I am actively working on building different web applications with **Django** to enhance my skills.

Feel free to explore the existing projects, and stay tuned for new additions as I continue to develop and improve them!

### 🚀 **Hosting and Deployment**

If you'd like to deploy these projects, you can host them on platforms like:

- [Render](https://render.com)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com)
- Or any other cloud platform.

You'll need to configure environment variables and set up a production database for hosting.
